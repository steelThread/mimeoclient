### Simple mimeograph client prototype.

## Getting Started

### Clone the git repo
<pre>
  $ git clone git@github.com:steelThread/mimeoclient.git
  $ cd mimeoclient
  $ gradle
</pre>

### Dependencies

The mimeoclient build system will install all dependencies required to build the project. The build system is based on [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) so you will need to install this using these
[directions](http://www.gradle.org/installation.html).  If you have a previously used maven and have a local maven repo then the build
attempts to fetch dependencies there first before trying the other registered public repos.
